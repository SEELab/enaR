OUTPUT = list of utility statistics}
\usage{
enaUtility(x, type = c("flow", "storage"), eigen.check = TRUE,
  balance.override = FALSE, tol = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a network object.  This includes all weighted flows into and out of
each node.  For the storage utility analysis this must also include the
amount of energy--matter stored at each node (biomass).}

\item{type}{Determines whether the flow or storage utility analysis is
returned.}

\item{balance.override}{LOGICAL: should model balancing be ignored.
enaUtility assumes that the network model is at steady-state.  The default
setting will not allow the function to be applied to models not at
steady-state.  However, when balance.override is set to TRUE, then the
function will work regardless.}

\item{tol}{The integral utility matrix is rounded to the number of digits
specified in tol.  This approximation eleminates very small numbers
introduced due to numerical error in the ginv function.  It does not
eliminate the small numerical error introduced in larger values, but does
truncate the numbers.}
}
\value{
\item{D}{Direct flow utility intensity matrix.  (fij-fji)/Ti for
i,j=1:n} \item{U}{Nondimensional integral flow utility} \item{Y}{Dimensional
integral flow utility} \item{ns}{If type is set to 'flow', this is a list of
flow utility network statistics including: the dominant eigenvalue of D
(lambda\_1D), flow based network synergism (synergism.F), and flow based
network mutualism (mutualism.F).} \item{DS}{Direct storage utility intensity
matrix.  (fij-fji)/xi for i,j=1:n} \item{US}{Nondimensional integral storage
utility} \item{YS}{Dimensional integral storage utility} \item{ns}{If type
is set to 'storage', this is a list of storage utility network statistics
including: the dominant eigenvalue of DS (lambda_1DS), storage based network
synergism (synergism.S), and storage based network mutualism (mutualism.S).}

Utility Analysis of Ecological Networks

Performs the flow and storage based utility analysis developed for
input-output network models of ecosystems.  It returns a set of matrices for
the direct and integral utilities as well as a set of utility based network
statistics.
