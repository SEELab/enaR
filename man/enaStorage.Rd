\usage{
enaStorage(x, balance.override = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A network object.  This This includes all weighted flows into and
out of each vertex as well as the amount of energy--matter stored at each
vertex.}

\item{balance.override}{LOGICAL: should an imbalanced model be analyzed?  If
FALSE, the functions checks to make sure the network model provided is at
steady-state.  If TRUE, then the function will run without ensuring that the
model meets the steady-state assumption.}
}
\value{
\item{X}{The storage values themselves.} \item{C}{output or
donor-storage normalized output-oriented direct flow intensity
matrix (Jacobian community matrix)} \item{S}{dimensionalized
integral output community matrix} \item{VS}{variance in expected
output-oriented residance times (Barber 1979)} \item{Q}{integral
output storage matrix - non-dimensional} \item{CP}{input or
recipient-storage normalized oriented flow intensity matrix
(Jacobian community matrix)} \item{SP}{dimensionalized integral
input community matrix} \item{VSP}{variance in expected
input-oriented residance times (Barber 1979)} \item{QP}{integral
input storage matrix - non-dimensional} \item{dt}{selected time
step to create P, PP, Q and QP - smallest whole number to make
diag(C) nonnegative} \item{RT}{node residence time (storage/outputs),
units of inverse time} \item{ns}{vector of the storage based whole
system network statistics.  These statistics include total system
storage (TSS), storage cycling index (CIS), Boundary storage
intensity (BSI), Direct storage intensity (DSI), Indirect storage
intensity (ISI), realized ratio of indirect-to-direct storage
(ID.S), unit input-oriented ratio of indirect-to-direct storage
intensities (IDS.I), unit output ratio of indirect-to-direct
storage intensities (IDS.O), input-oriented storage-based network
homogenization (HMG.S.I), output-oriented storage-based network
homogenization (HMG.S.O), input-oriented storage-based network
amplification (AMP.S.I), output-oriented storage-based network
amplification (AMP.S.O), Storage from Boundary flow (mode0.S),
storage from internal first passage flow (mode1.S), storage from
cycled flow (mode2.S), dissipative equivalent to mode1.S (mode3.S),
dissipative equivalent to mode0.S (mode4.S), Average Residence Time (ART)}
